This is a Todo App built with Flutter that allows users to keep track of their day-to-day tasks. It provides an easy-to-use interface to add, edit, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. The app enables users to manage their to-do list effectively by storing tasks locally on the device.


Add New Tasks: Users can add new tasks using a text input field. Tasks are added to a list and displayed immediately after entering them.
Task Completion: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking the checkbox. When a task is marked as completed, it will have a line-through effect to indicate its completion.
Task Deletion: Users can delete individual tasks from the list.
Clear All Tasks: A button is available to clear all tasks from the list at once.
Task Details: Users can tap on a task to see its details in a pop-up dialog.
